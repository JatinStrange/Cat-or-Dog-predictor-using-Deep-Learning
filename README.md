# Cat-or-Dog-prediction
The main goal of this project is to develop a system that can identify images of cats and dogs. The input image will be analyzed and then the output is predicted. 
The model that is implemented can be extended to a website or any mobile device as per the need. 
The Dogs vs Cats dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website. The dataset contains a set of images of cats and dogs. 
Our main aim here is for the model to learn various distinctive features of cat and dog. Once the training of the model is done it will be able to differentiate images of cat and dog.
